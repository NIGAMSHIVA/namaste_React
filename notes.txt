2. You can write JS inside JSX between {} These Curly braces. 

3. Javascript variable should be called only after declaring.

5.React Components can be rendered through the <Component /> or <Component></Component>

6.React Component can also be called by {componentName()} or <componentName /> .But this wont work in render.In render 
you have to do only <componentName />

7.If you see in browser the css and app filee are named differently like namaste_react[Hash].css or js .The parcel
do this to trick the browser into thinking that this files is new ,so reload it .
therefore older version may not stick to it.

JS functions.

11.Config Driven UI-Config is data,data in handling the UI.Instead of writing 1000 restaurant in the UI .Do it in Data side and
and just do the map in the UI.Important example-> In food apps like Swiggy You see different offers in kolkata & diffeent in Kanpur.If the UI was not config Driven
then it would be the seperate app for seperate city.Thats why Config Driven UI is Important.
